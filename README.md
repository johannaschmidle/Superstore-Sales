# Superstore Sales

# Project Background
Superstore, founded over a decade ago, is a fictional U.S.-based retail company specializing in a wide range of consumer and office products, available through its website and mobile app. The company has significant data on sales, operations, marketing, and customer behaviors. But much of this data has yet to be fully leveraged for strategic decision-making. This project undertakes a comprehensive analysis to unlock valuable insights that can enhance Superstoreâ€™s market position.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:
- **Sales Trends Analysis:**  Review of historical sales by product category and region, focusing on Revenue, Order Volume, and Average Order Value (AOV).
- **Product Performance:** Assessment of top-performing products and categories, including an evaluation of Return Rates.
- **Customer Retention:** Analysis of customer segments to enhance retention, including impact assessment of discount strategies.
- **Regional Sales Patterns:** Comparative analysis of sales and order volume across regions to identify market-specific trends and opportunities.

The Python code used to inspect and clean the data for this analysis can be found here [link].

An interactive Tableau dashboard used to report and explore sales trends can be found here [link].

# Data Structure & Initial Checks
Data can be downloaded [here](https://community.tableau.com/s/question/0D54T00000CWeX8SAL/sample-superstore-sales-excelxls)

The companies main database structure as seen below consists of four tables: Orders, Returns, People with a total row count of X records. A description of each table is as follows:
- **Orders:** represents individual transactions or orders placed by customers
- **Returns:** represents orders that have been returned, including information on which orders were returned
- **People:** represents salespeople or employees associated with different region

# Executive Summary

### Overview of Findings

Explain the overarching findings, trends, and themes in 2-3 sentences here. This section should address the question: "If a stakeholder were to take away 3 main insights from your project, what are the most important things they should know?" You can put yourself in the shoes of a specific stakeholder - for example, a marketing manager or finance director - to think creatively about this section.

# Assumptions and Caveats:

Throughout the analysis, multiple assumptions were made to manage challenges with the data. These assumptions and caveats are noted below:

* Assumption 1 (ex: missing country records were for customers based in the US, and were re-coded to be US citizens)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: data for December 2021 was missing - this was imputed using a combination of historical trends and December 2020 data)
  
* Assumption 1 (ex: because 3% of the refund date column contained non-sensical dates, these were excluded from the analysis)
